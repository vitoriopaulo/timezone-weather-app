# Timezone Weather App

## Description

The **Timezone Weather** app is designed to help users view the weather forecast for up to 7 different zones. It is particularly useful for digital nomads and travelers alike. The app features a minimalist, user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.

Built with a tech stack of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this front-end application stores data locally, making it a privacy-conscious choice for users.
